title: "Where is wellness going?"
event: CAPAL 2022
event_url: ../../event/capal-2022

# location: https://zoom.us/j/99077508905

abstract: For several years we have had conversations about student well-being and student mental health. Wellness initiatives are also becoming more common in libraries and institutions of higher learning. These initiatives show that the institution recognizes the benefits of wellness (in production, retention, and engagement), but has that attention turned toward employee well-being in the same way that it has for student well-being? How do institutions utilize employee well-being in policy and organizational planning? The goal of this talk is to review some literature that has already been developed based on employee well-being, with an emphasis on academic libraries; however, I will also point out areas that we may want to look at for future growth opportunities.
