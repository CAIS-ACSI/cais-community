abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought many challenges and has had a significant effect on students’ learning. Many students have expressed feeling higher levels of stress and anxiety due to constant changes in their academic and personal lives. During this time, librarians at Saint Paul University saw a dramatic increase in plagiarism cases and requests for academic integrity workshops. Due to this high demand, questions arose surrounding various factors that could be impacting students' attitudes towards plagiarism and academic fraud. This presentation discusses correlations between students’ mental health and engagement, and students' attitudes and beliefs regarding academic integrity. We will then propose strategies to bridge these gaps.
