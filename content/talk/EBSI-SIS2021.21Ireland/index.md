title: "A Small Presentation about Small Books"
event: 13th EBSI-SIS Symposium
event_url: ../../event/ebsi-sis-2021

location: https://zoom.us/j/91952595188

abstract: "My presentation is a short introduction to chapbooks. McGill’s library has a large, digitized collection of chapbooks, and I hope to address some of the material aspects of chapbooks—how were they printed, circulated, etc.—and how these books were used in literary culture. Another interest surrounding chapbooks is how the common stories in these books changed over time or among different printers."
