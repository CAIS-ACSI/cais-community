abstract: "The increase in use of the digital medium for publishing information has made information creation easier and cheaper resulting in abundance of information as observed in the case of academic information (Wang, et al 2012). The existence of abundance of information sources poses the problem of information overload and choices. Information sources can be grouped into two based on cost: free sources and paid sources. Previous studies have established that people tend to have good perceptions about products with high prices compared to those they get for free (Plassmann, et al, 2008). Will information seekers prefer free to paid sources and how can information providers take advantage of the phenomenon in comparison to other factors influencing information source choices to draw information seekers to their contents? This study sought to examine: -the importance of the cost of access to information seekers compared to other factors considered when selecting information sources, -how they perceive the value of free and paid sources, -and their willingness to use paid information sources. This study was a preliminary study for a PhD dissertation using the exploratory method (experience survey sampling) which surveyed librarians working at the McGill and Concordia university libraries. This study will contribute to the academic discourse on making information available for free or for a fee. It will also help information providers/publishers to make the right decisions about cost, interface design and content. Information literacy personnel's can also draw from it and educate information seeker on the psychology of seeking information."
