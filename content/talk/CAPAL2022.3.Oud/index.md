title: "Disability and wellness: An equity caution for libraries"
event: CAPAL 2022
event_url: ../../event/capal-2022

# location: https://zoom.us/j/99077508905

abstract: Wellness is a fraught concept from the perspective of disability. Disability in our society is associated with pain, illness, suffering, and limitation. In other words, with the opposite of health and wellness. This session will examine the conceptual underpinnings of our social ideas of wellness and its link to neoliberalism. It will link wellness to our social views of disability, and show how the connection disadvantages people with disabilities and other marginalized groups. Finally, it will examine some wellness programming in academic libraries from the critical disability perspective, and give suggestions for alternatives to some of the current academic library approaches.
